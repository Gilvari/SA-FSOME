In industrial environments, only a few samples of normal and abnormal data are typically available, making it essential to develop models that can effectively distinguish between the two. In this paper, we propose SA-FSOME, a modified version of the FewSOME model, which incorporates a small number of synthetic abnormal samples during training. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and generalization in few-shot settings. Experimental evaluations on the MVTec AD and Metal Triangle datasets demonstrate that SA-FSOME consistently outperforms the original FewSOME model across multiple performance metrics.
